## Hi there, I'm Clark ðŸ‘‹

I've built systems that have helped people [improve crop yields](https://dawnequipment.com/), [reduce manufacturing defects](https://fastradius.com), [find the parts](https://www.grainger.com/) they need, and [get rewarded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belly_(loyalty_program)) for shopping at their favorite merchants.

I have experience writing machine control code, implementing computational geometry algorithms from academic papers, processing and analyzing big data, profiling bottlenecks and implementing performance improvements, and of course, fixing bugs up and down the stack.

I love teaching, mentoring junior engineers, public speaking, and helping companies define their engineering culture.

I've worked with many technologies but my most recent deep professional experience is in Rust, Elixir, and SQLite, among others.

If you'd like to work together or just want to chat, feel free to reach out.
